## The Problem

Despite ambitious government initiatives like the **Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Yojana (PMSGY)** aiming for 30 GW of residential solar capacity, adoption remains slow. Homeowners are often hindered by:

- **Information Asymmetry:** A lack of clear, personalized data on potential savings, costs, and payback periods.
- **Financial Uncertainty:** Confusion around complex and varying subsidy schemes (central and state).
- **Technical Complexity:** Difficulty in choosing the right panel capacity, technology, and battery backup system.
- **Infrastructural Hurdles:** Delays in net metering and supply chain issues.

## The Solution

**Solar Helper** tackles these challenges head-on. It's a one-stop web platform that leverages Machine Learning and Geospatial analysis to empower users. By simply providing their monthly electricity bill and location, users receive a comprehensive, AI-generated report tailored to their specific needs, helping them make confident and informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Savings Calculator:** Instantly estimates monthly, annual, and 25-year savings, along with your potential carbon offset.
- **AI Recommendation Engine:** A multi-step process that analyzes your location, energy needs, property size, and budget to recommend:
  - Optimal Solar Panel Capacity (kW)
  - Panel Technology (e.g., Monocrystalline)
  - Battery System (Type, Capacity, Backup Duration)
  - Detailed Cost and Subsidy Breakdown
- **Subsidy Navigator:** Automatically calculates and explains applicable central (PMSGY) and state-specific subsidies.
- **Energy Yield Prediction:** Utilizes a `LightGBM` model trained on historical weather and solar irradiance data to forecast monthly power generation with **81% accuracy**.
- **Dual AI Chat Support:**
  - **Subsidy Expert:** A specialized chatbot fine-tuned on government policies to answer all subsidy-related questions.
  - **General Expert:** A helpful assistant for general queries about solar technology, maintenance, and benefits.
- **LLM-Powered Web Scraping:** A sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline keeps our subsidy and policy data up-to-date by intelligently scraping and understanding information from government portals.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Fully responsive and installable on mobile devices for a native app-like experience.

## System Architecture

The platform is built on a monolithic backend with a decoupled frontend. The core logic revolves around three main data flows: the Savings Calculator, the Recommendation Engine, and the Support Chat, all powered by a combination of ML models and LLM-driven agents.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-helper.git
    cd solar-helper
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**

    ```sh
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file and add your API key
    echo "GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'" > .env
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**

    ```sh
    cd ../frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory, start the FastAPI server:

    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    From the `frontend` directory, start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Future Scope

The current platform lays a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:

- **Advanced Yield Modeling:** Revisit LSTM or explore Transformer-based models with more granular weather data for even higher prediction accuracy.
- **Smart Meter Integration:** Allow users to connect their smart meter data (with consent) for hyper-personalized consumption profiles and recommendations.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Monitor the performance of installed systems and send alerts for cleaning or potential issues.
- **Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading:** For grid-connected users, suggest models for selling excess power to neighbors, potentially integrated with blockchain for transparency.
